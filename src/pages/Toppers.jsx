  const deekshaReview = `2025 was my fourth attempt at the RBI examination, and by God’s grace, I secured AIR-2 this year. I started following Mock Mentor in 2024, and in 2025, I enrolled in their courses available at the time.\n\nOne of the biggest strengths of Mock Mentor was the quality of their content, the magazines were extremely well-curated, crisp, authentic and highly exam-focused. As a working aspirant with limited preparation time, the concise and relevant material helped me prepare comprehensively in a very efficient manner. The return on investment was truly exceptional.\n\nThe fortnightly MCQs played an important role in helping me revise consistently and stay aligned with the exam requirements. I particularly found the Phase 2 MCQs to be highly underrated, as they helped me build a holistic understanding of the syllabus. In fact, I scored 43 marks in Management, and Mock Mentor’s content played a significant role in that achievement.\n\nI also extensively used their descriptive preparation resources, which proved immensely helpful. In Finance, Management, and ESI descriptive papers, I scored 35+ marks. Overall, the content remained highly relevant, concise, and exam-oriented throughout my preparation journey. For any serious RBI aspirant, especially working professionals, Mock Mentor can be a very valuable companion in the preparation process.`;  const atithiReview = `2025 was my first attempt at the RBI examination, and I enrolled in the Interview Guidance Program by Mock Mentor. Initially, I was quite insecure and had very little clarity regarding what to prepare and what to study for the interview.\n\nHowever, with the continuous support and guidance of Team Mock Mentor, the entire process became much more structured and manageable. They provided significant help in preparing my biodata in a cohesive and effective manner, which gave me much-needed confidence. The team also guided me towards relevant certification courses that played an important role in strengthening my interview preparation.\n\nWith their mentorship and support, I was able to score 57 Mark's in the interview. I am truly grateful to Team Mock Mentor for being a valuable partner throughout my interview journey.\n\nPhase 1 phase 2 ka kaam to smjh gya tha mai but aap na hote to shayd 2-3 bar khena pdd jta interview ka khel mujhe iski demand smjhne me aur ise kaise tackle Krna h ye clear krne me\n\nThankyou sir 🙃😁☺️❤️`;

  const karthikReview = `Sir,\n\nI am delighted to share that I have been selected as an RBI Grade B Officer. I sincerely express my gratitude to Mockmentor for the support.\n\nI came across the Mockmentor channel around February 2025. Having appeared for three mains examinations prior to 2025, I found your content to be distinct, highly relevant, and closely aligned with the requirements of the examination.\n\nThe curated coverage of newspapers, PIB updates, RBI and SEBI circulars, reports, and related content made preparation more structured and efficient. Since the important information was already highlighted, it became easier for me to study and prepare additional physical notes wherever required.\n\nI benefitted greatly from the content, which helped secure decent marks in both the Phase I General Awareness section and the Phase II ESI objective section. Beyond objective preparation, the material was equally useful for descriptive answers. For e.g, speeches of the SEBI Chairman,directors shared through the channel helped me in attempting the 15-mark question on reforms in capital markets.\n\nI sincerely believe that your content offers informational richness for aspirants and adds value to their preparation.\n\nI am truly thankful to Mockmentor for being an integral part of my journey and contributing to my success.\n\nThanks and regards,\nSankar S.\n2862003939\nTotal Marks: 230.5`;

  const himanshiReview = `MockMentor’s contribution to my RBI Grade B preparation journey has been truly unparalleled. I joined the program right after the Phase 1 results, and it proved to be one of the most valuable decisions in my preparation.\n\nThe standout feature of the course was the descriptive writing section and its detailed evaluation. The questions were of exceptional quality, and I relied entirely on MockMentor for my descriptive practice. This significantly enhanced both my content and answer structuring skills.The objective section was equally impressive, with questions closely aligned to the actual exam level. It included scheme-based, report-based, and case study-oriented questions that mirrored the pattern and depth of the real examination. Also, on the telegram group the highlighted RBI circulars categorised as less important, important and very important were uploaded which added further depth.\n\nThe interview guidance program was another major highlight. Rahul Sir’s one-on-one discussion on my biodata was extremely insightful. He helped rationalize every aspect of my profile, even the smallest details, which ultimately made a significant difference during the interview.\n\nAdditionally, the support team was always approachable and prompt in resolving doubts. The three mock interviews conducted were comprehensive, featuring diverse and opinion-based questions that closely resembled the actual interview experience.\n\nI am extremely grateful to MockMentor for their guidance and support. I truly owe a significant part of my success to them and could not have imagined this journey without their mentorship.\n\nThank you so much! 🙏💐\nHimanshi`;

It was nice, so I explored the channel and was amazed by the quality of the highlighted content available absolutely free of cost. I joined the channel and made a habit of regularly reading the articles.\n\nA few weeks later, MM introduced their GA MCQ package, and it had quality content. It helped a lot. The articles (newspapers, BS, RBI circulars), complemented with the AC magazine, were my one-stop solution for GA.\n\nLater, I joined the Phase 2 and Interview Guidance Program of MM, and it helped a lot. The quality of descriptive questions and comprehensive evaluation made learning interesting.\n\nThe interview guidance by Rahul Sir was in a positive direction. It helped in building confidence and getting content ready for the interview.\n\nOverall, MM made my journey smooth. I was able to read and retain better even with a full-time job.\n\nधन्यवाद। शुक्रिया। आभार。\n\nThanks & regards,\nSaurabh Sharma`;

The quality of questions and your one on one support in vetting my DAF and also your patience in clearing my doubts even small ones really helped me. MockMentor specifically for interview was a game changer for me.\n\nYou handholded me in every step. I sent my DAF to you I believe 5-6 times and you helped me create a strong document. You provided around 400 questions on the basis of my DAF related to my background, academic, job and also helped me connect with like minded people. \n\nSir, Today I think if I would have not came across you what would I have done. And to sum it up. I believe MockMentor has been my support system for interview preparation.`;

I came to know about his interview mentorship programme through a friend and I immediately wanted to enroll with him for his guidance. Unlike, any other individual or institute, he was not willing to accept anybody for the sake of it. He wanted to first assess whether he could really add value to the aspirant's preparation or not. And before this assessment, he even declined to accept fees.\n\nI have appeared for three RBI Grade B interviews earlier as well. But Rahul Sir was able to pinpoint my improvement area in our first call itself. This assessment significantly improved my approach for the interview. He helped me further by providing me a detailed personalised list of questions for every aspect of my profile. \n\nI enrolled on other programs as well, many of them were good and many not so good. But none of them provided as personalised guidance as Rahul Sir. He was always available and eager to take our doubts. He treated every aspirant as his friend. His patience and kind nature made him very approachable.\n\nThe mock interview questions were meticulously designed for each candidate's profile. His demeanor during the mock interview was apt for preparing us for the real interview. And his feedbacks were honest, to the point and supporting.\n\nI will be forever thankful to him for his support.`;

Your immediate motivation and guidance worked wonders.\nThank you sir.\nReally grateful.  :)`;
