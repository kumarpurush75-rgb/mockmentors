I started following MockMentor in 2024, and in 2025, I enrolled in their available courses for Phase 2 preparation.\n\nOne of the biggest strengths of MockMentor was the exceptional quality of their content. The current affairs magazines were extremely well-curated, concise, authentic, and highly exam-oriented. As a working aspirant with limited preparation time, having access to crisp and relevant material helped me prepare comprehensively in a very efficient manner. The return on investment was truly remarkable.\n\nThe fortnightly MCQs played a crucial role in ensuring consistent revision and keeping me aligned with the evolving exam pattern. I particularly found the Phase 2 MCQs to be highly underrated, as they helped me develop a holistic understanding of the syllabus and improve conceptual clarity. In fact, I scored 43 marks in Management, and MockMentor’s content contributed significantly to that achievement.\n\nI also extensively utilized their descriptive preparation resources, which proved immensely valuable. In Finance, Management, and ESI descriptive papers, I scored 35+ marks. The answer-writing guidance, practice material, and exam-oriented approach helped me improve both structure and presentation in descriptive papers.\n\nAdditionally, their interview guidance sessions were extremely insightful and helped me build confidence for the final stage of the examination.\n\nOverall, MockMentor’s content remained highly relevant, concise, and exam-focused throughout my preparation journey. For serious RBI aspirants, especially working professionals looking for efficient and high-quality preparation resources , MockMentor can be an invaluable companion in the RBI Grade B journey.`,

I joined the program right after the Phase 1 results, and it proved to be one of the most valuable decisions in my preparation.\n\nThe standout feature of the course was the descriptive writing section and its detailed evaluation. The questions were of exceptional quality, and I relied entirely on MockMentor for my descriptive practice. This significantly enhanced both my content and answer structuring skills.The objective section was equally impressive, with questions closely aligned to the actual exam level. It included scheme-based, report-based, and case study-oriented questions that mirrored the pattern and depth of the real examination. Also, on the telegram group the highlighted RBI circulars categorised as less important, important and very important were uploaded which added further depth.\n\nThe interview guidance program was another major highlight. Rahul Sir’s one-on-one discussion on my biodata was extremely insightful. He helped rationalize every aspect of my profile, even the smallest details, which ultimately made a significant difference during the interview.\n\nAdditionally, the support team was always approachable and prompt in resolving doubts. The three mock interviews conducted were comprehensive, featuring diverse and opinion-based questions that closely resembled the actual interview experience.\n\nI am extremely grateful to MockMentor for their guidance and support. I truly owe a significant part of my success to them and could not have imagined this journey without their mentorship.\n\nThank you so much! 🙏💐\nHimanshi`,

      q: "How many questions will be covered every fortnight?",
      a: "Each fortnight includes **100 questions**, distributed as:\n\n* 25 questions from RBI & SEBI Circulars\n* 25 questions from PIB\n* 25 questions from Schemes & Reports\n* 25 questions from Miscellaneous General Awareness\n\nThis effectively means **200 questions every month**, covering almost every relevant update from the exam perspective."
    },
    {
      q: "How to effectively use the content and mocks?",
      a: "The content related to RBI & SEBI circulars, PIB, schemes & reports, and important newspaper clippings is shared daily on the Mock Mentor Telegram channel in a highlighted and concise format.\n\nThe highlighted content from original sources helps aspirants gain confidence that they are studying authentic and exam-relevant material while also making revision more efficient.\n\n### Step-by-step approach to utilize the content effectively:\n\n1. Read everything shared daily on the Telegram channel.\n2. Revise the content of each fortnight by the 15th and 30th of every month.\n3. Attempt the mock tests on the 15th and 30th/31st of every month.\n\nFollowing this simple strategy helps aspirants stay exam-ready after every 15 days, which is the core vision behind launching fortnightly mocks."
    },
    {
      q: "Isn’t the price too high?",
      a: "We don’t believe so, as long as we are delivering high-quality and exam-relevant content.\n\nOur philosophy regarding pricing is simple:\n\n* Either provide content completely free\n* Or price it according to the quality and value being delivered\n\n### What we provide:\n\n* High-Quality Highlighted Content Free of Cost\n* High-Quality Exam-Relevant Mock Tests Reasonably priced according to quality\n\nFor the RBI Grade B 2024 and 2025 batch, we also provided premium interview guidance that included:\n\n* 4 one-to-one mock interview sessions\n* Personalized mentorship\n* Profile-based question framing\n\nThe feedback received from toppers clearly reflected the value and effectiveness of the program."
