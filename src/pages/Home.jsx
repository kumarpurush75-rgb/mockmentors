Your fortnightly MCQs, magazines, Phase 2 objective MCQ package, and descriptive content were exceptionally accurate and highly relevant. The precise and well-curated content made my RBI preparation much easier.",
      fullText: `2025 was my fourth attempt at the RBI examination, and by God’s grace, I secured AIR-2 this year. I started following Mock Mentor in 2024, and in 2025, I enrolled in their courses available at the time.\n\nOne of the biggest strengths of Mock Mentor was the quality of their content, the magazines were extremely well-curated, crisp, authentic and highly exam-focused. As a working aspirant with limited preparation time, the concise and relevant material helped me prepare comprehensively in a very efficient manner. The return on investment was truly exceptional.\n\nThe fortnightly MCQs played an important role in helping me revise consistently and stay aligned with the exam requirements. I particularly found the Phase 2 MCQs to be highly underrated, as they helped me build a holistic understanding of the syllabus. In fact, I scored 43 marks in Management, and Mock Mentor’s content played a significant role in that achievement.\n\nI also extensively used their descriptive preparation resources, which proved immensely helpful. In Finance, Management, and ESI descriptive papers, I scored 35+ marks. Overall, the content remained highly relevant, concise, and exam-oriented throughout my preparation journey. For any serious RBI aspirant, especially working professionals, Mock Mentor can be a very valuable companion in the preparation process.`,

Business Standard I read everything to grasp what is being said with full context (helped me to Tackle corporate banking question in Interview)\n\nI read and took note of  Every post they shared which includes PIB, Business standard newspapers, CIRCULARS of RBI & SEBI , SCHEMES etc\n\nI've gained a lot of confidence through revision by their "Weekly revision capsules".\n\nItz MCQ for phase 2 was best in the market especially for CA. I didn't do any Descriptive practice from there.\n\nMockmentor Shared list of Reports important for Phase 2 : Filtered the clutter for me.\n\nMockmentor Interview Guidance Programme : Gold\n\nTheir Interview guidance programme was Top Notch. Despite me not giving any mock interview there, Their\n\nDetailed questionnaire about each aspect of my profile was a goldmine for me and the list of things to cover for Interview for RBI such as Departmental questions based on my selection, working and functions PDF highlights were really good.\n\nTo be frank, I would have never known importance of department related questions without Mockmentor.\n\nAlso I was highly benefited from their private interview telegram Channel from my fellow Mates\n\nMockmentor support : Their personalized support system played a crucial role. Individual queries were addressed promptly, helping resolve critical doubts during preparation.\n\nI also found that Mockmentor materials have strong spillover benefits, helping in preparation for other exams as well.\n\nI am immensely grateful to the Mockmentor Telegram channel and Rahul sir for helping me ace this exam.\n\nI am truly delighted and will always remain thankful.\n\nBy : Hari Jegan Prathap S`,
